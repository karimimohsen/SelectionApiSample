        <h2>
            Selection
        </h2>
        <p>
            user may make a selection from left to right (in document order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The anchor
            is where the user began the
            <span>selection and the
                <b>focus</b> is where the
                <i>user ends</i> the selection.</span> If you make a selection with a desktop mouse, the anchor is placed where
            you pressed the mouse button and the focus is placed where you released the mouse button. Anchor and focus should
            not be confused with the start and end positions of a selection, since anchor can be placed before the focus
            or vice versa, depending on the direction you made your selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Returns a number representing the offset of the selection's anchor within the focusNode. If focusNode is a text node, this
            is the number of characters within focusNode preceding the focus. If focusNode is an element, this is the number
            of child nodes of the focusNode preceding the focus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Selection API has a common behaviour (i.e. shared between browsers) that govern how focus behaviour changes for editing
            hosts, after some of its methods are called.
        </p>
        <p>
            A range is a contiguous part of a document. A range can contain entire nodes as well as portions of nodes, such as a portion
            of a text node. A user will normally only select a single range at a time, but it's possible for a user to select
            multiple ranges (e.g. by using the Control key). A range can be retrieved from a selection as a range object.
            Range objects can also be created via the DOM and programmatically added or removed from a selection
